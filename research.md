## Stress & resilience

In my current position in the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience lab of Erno Hermans at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour at Radboudumc, I got interested in the neuroscience of stress-related mental disorders, and especially in stress-related large-scale brain network changes. My research aims at finding innovative new ways to promote and sustain mental health by strengthening resilience to stress in real life.

## Neurofeedback & self-regulation

When working on the European BRAINTRAIN project as a postdoctoral researcher with Rainer Goebel at Brain Innovation B.V. and Maastricht University, I started exploring how the self-regulation of brain networks by (combined) Electroencephalography (EEG) and especially real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback can be methodologically further advanced to be utilised as a therapeutic measure for mental disorders. My research focuses on developing innovative new paradigms and their clinical applications.

## Research methods & technologies

I use a large variety of different methodology in my work, ranging from behavioural and physiological measures, over real-life assessments with mobile devices and wearables, to advanced neuroimaging. With my research I aim to actively contribute to the constant improvement and development of state-of-the-art methods and technologies.

## Embodied & numerical cognition

During my PhD at the Donders Institute at Radboud University, with Harold Bekkering, Ivan Toni and Oliver Lindemann, I got concerned with the question of how former sensorimotor experiences shape our cognition and how differences in these experiences can lead to individual traits in cognitive functions. My research focuses on the neurocognitive representation of numerical magnitude and the question of whether numerical concepts are "grounded" in former sensorimotor experiences with size in everyday life.
