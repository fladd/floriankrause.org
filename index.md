# About me

I am a researcher in Cognitive/Affective Neuroscience, currently working at the Cognitive Neuroscience department, [Donders Institute](https://ru.nl/donders), [RadboudUMC Nijmegen](https://www.radboudumc.nl) and the department of Psychiatry, [Brain+Nerve Center](https://hersenenzenuwcentrum.mumc.nl), [MaastrichtUMC+](https://mumc.nl).

My main research interests include **stress**, **resilience**, **mental health**, **advanced (real-time) neuroimaging**, **neurofeedback**, **large-scale brain networks**, **embodied cognition** and **numerical cognition**.

I am a strong advocate of **Open Science** and the **development of free methods and software technologies**. My best know contribution in this domain is [Expyriment](https://www.expyriment.org), a Python library for designing and conducting timing-critical bahavioural and neuroimaging experiments.
