# About me

I am a researcher in Cognitive Neuroscience, currently working for [Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/patient-care) at the [Donders Institute](https://ru.nl/donders) in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

My main research interests include **(real-time) fMRI**, **neurofeedback**, **large-scale brain networks**, **stress**, **resilience**, **embodied cognition** and **numerical cognition**.

I am also the main developer of [Expyriment](https://www.expyriment.org), a Python library for designing and conducting timing-critical bahavioural and neuroimaging experiments.
